The game is split into 2 projects: Game1 and XMLData.

Game1 contains classes that do not rely on data from *.xml files, which includes
the main class where everything in being drawn, and most math-heavy classes.

XMLData contains most classes, as it contains classes relying on *.xml files and 
classes referencing these.
